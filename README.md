# Python
Houses all my independent Python scripts to display some of my work

- SQL Looper - Oracle: A script to carry out SQL queries in Oracle, this one loops through the query to execute it for each periodic table. It was made to be accessible for users that have little knowledge of Python.

- Weather Tracker: A script that connects to the MET office API to get todays weather forecast for the specified regions in Great Britain.

- Group or filter a file: This can manipulate the contents of a file, grouping or filtering to the user requirements. Originally designed for a specific file we work with that is too big for Excel.
